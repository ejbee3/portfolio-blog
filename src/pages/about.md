I started my coding journey in 2019 when I attended a 10 week, full-time bootcamp in St. Pete, FL, to learn full stack web development. I learned Javascript and C# to build my capstone project, which was an ed-tech app to help teachers keep track of their students' attendence.

Fast forward to now, I've worked professionally in Python, Ruby, and Javascript, my favorite stack is Sveltekit with Supabase, and I'm learning Rust to complement my frontend expertise.
